      - Recursive algorithm to calculater long int numbers. <br />
2. Merge Sort algorithm & Count Inversions (IntegerArray.txt is used) <br />
      - Divide and conquer, recursive algorithms. <br />
      - Merge Sort is to recursively sort 1st and 2nd half of the input array, then merge two sorted sublists into one. <br />
      - Count Inversions is to count number of pairs(i,j) of array indices with i<j and A[i] > A[j]. Using Merge Sort  <br />
3. Quick Sort algorithm (QuickSort.txt is used)  <br />
      - To sort an array by choosing a pivot and rearrange the array by putting amount less than pivot to the left of pivot, and others to the right <br />
4. Randomized Contraction algorithm (kargerMinCut.txt is used)  <br />
      - Compute a cut with fewest number of crossing edges in a Graph. (a mininum cut) <br />


**2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**
1. Kosarajuâ€™s Two Pass algorithm w Depth First Search algorithm and stack (SCC.txt and test.txt are used)  <br />
      - Compute Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) using Depth First Search algorithm (DFS).  <br />
2. Dijkstra algorithm with heap (dijkstraData.txt is used) <br />
      - Find shortest path distance to all vertices in the Graph from the starting vertex. <br /> 
3. Median Maintenance algorithm with heap (median.txt is used) <br /> 
      - Find the median using Min-heap and Max-heap. <br /> 
4. 2-sum algorithm with Hash Tables (2sum.txt is used) <br /> 
      - Find out whether there are two elements x and y from unsorted array A of n integers that sum up to Target sum t.  <br /> 


**3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**
1. Prim's MST (Minimum Spanning Trees) algorithm with heap (edges.txt and jobs.txt are used) <br /> 
      - Minimum Spanning Trees: Connect a bunch of points together as cheaply as possible (with minimum costs), meaning minimum total costs tree T having edges that spans all vertices. (1) T has no cycles, (2) the subgraph (V, T) is connected. <br /> 
      - Loop through edges by accending cost, add to total costs if at least one vertex hasn't visited, till all vertices are visited. <br /> 
2. Kruskal's MST Algorithm with Union Find data structure (clustering_big.txt and clustering1.txt are used) <br /> 
      - Minimum Spanning Trees: Connect a bunch of points together as cheaply as possible (with minimum costs), meaning minimum cost tree T having edges that spans all vertices. <br />
      - Union Find data structure: Maintain one linked structure per connected component of (V, T); Each component has an arbitrary leader vertex; When new edge (u, v) added to T, connected components of u & v merge; When two components merge, have smaller one inherit the leader of the larger one. Given edge (u, v), can check if u & v already in same component in O(1) time. <br />
      - Using Kruskal's MST Algorithm to find out maximum spacing of a k-Clustering. Let p, q = closest pair of separated points. Merge the clusters containing p & q into a single cluster, until only k clusters left. <br />
3. Huffman's Codes Algorithm with heap and WIS in path graph Algorithm  (huffman.txt and mwis.txt are used) <br />
      - Huffman's Codes Algorithm using heap: binary prefix-free encoding tree for a given set of characters based on their frequencies/weight. <br />
      - WIS in path graph Algorithm using dynamic programming: to get subset of nonadjacent vertices - an independent set - that gets maximum total weight. <br />
4. Knapsack Algorithm (knapsack_big.txt and knapsack1.txt are used) <br />
      - Knapsack Algorithm using dynamic programming and cache: to calculate maximum sum value within the capacity <br />

1. Johnson's Algorithm with Bellman-Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm (g1.txt, g2.txt and g3.txt are used) <br />
      - To compute the length of a shortest u -> v path for all pairs of vertices u, v in graph; or report that the graph contains a negative cycle. <br />
2. Traveling Salesman Problem Algorithm (tsp.txt is used) <br />
      - To compute the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour of 25 cities and only visit each city once. Dynamic programming and NP-Complete is used;
            Challenge of this algorithm is that it needs lots of memory. <br />
3. Heuristic TSP Algorithm (nn.txt is used) <br />
      - To **APPROXIMATELY** compute the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour of cities and only visit each city once. Nearest Neighbor Heuristic TSP Algorithm on sorted large set of data (sorted by x-axis). <br />
      - Challenge of this algorithm is to know how to stop early on searching minimum distance from start city to possible end city. <br />
