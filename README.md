3. Huffman's Codes Algorithm with heap and WIS in path graph Algorithm  (huffman.txt and mwis.txt are used) <br />
      &nbsp Huffman's Codes Algorithm using heap: binary prefix-free encoding tree for a given set of characters based on their frequencies/weight. <br />
      &nbsp WIS in path graph Algorithm using dynamic programming: to get subset of nonadjacent vertices - an independent set - that gets maximum total weight. <br />
